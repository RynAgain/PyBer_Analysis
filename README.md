# PyBer_Analysis
 Module 5

## Overview

The project is a hypothetical task given by a company called "V. Isualize".  The company has provided ride-sharing and user data which, I will use to construct an analysis using Pandas. Then I will utilize Matplotlib to quickly construct visualizations for the data.

## Results

The summary DataFrame shows that;
 - The rural city type experiences a shortage in drivers making the total rides in 2019 very low and average fare per driver the highest as compared with other city types.
 - This is followed by suburban city type with a medium average fare per driver due to the total number of rides.
 - Urban city types has the lowest fare per driver making the average fare per ride the lowest as compared with the other city types over a four months period in 2019.

The multiple-line chart shows that;
 - The total fare per city type is highest over a period of four months in 2019
 - The reverse is the case with the rural city type having the lowest total fare
 - The suburban city type is next to the urban city in terms of hierarchy
 - Peak periods of the month with the highest fares for all city types was seen at the beginning of the last week of February and at the same time, the suburban city type experiences teh highest drop in fare during the last week in february

## Summary

Focus on urban areas as they have the largest volume of rides.  This high volume even offsets the lower average cost of the ride. Since the average revenue of the rural locales is so much higher than the other two categories, experimenting with the number of rural drivers to analyze their effect on the average revenue may be warranted to determine the optimum number of rural drivers to maximize revenue from the rural sector.
